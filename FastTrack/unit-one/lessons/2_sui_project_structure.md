# Sui Project Structure 

## Sui Module and Package

- A Sui module is a set of functions and types packed together which the developer publishes under a specific address 

- The Sui standard library is published under the `0x2` address, while user deployed modules are published under a pseodorandom address assigned by the Sui Move VM

- Module starts with the `module` keyword, which is followed by module name and curly braces - inside them module contents are placed:

    ```
    module hello_world {

        // module contents

    }
    ```

- Published modules are immutable objects in Sui; an immutable object is an object that can never be mutated, transferred or deleted. Because of this immutability, the object is not owned by anyone, and hence it can be used by anyone

- A package is a collection of modules

## Initializing a Sui Move Package

Use the following Sui CLI command to start a skeleton Sui package:

`sui move new <PACKAGE NAME>`

For our example in this unit, we will start a Hello World project:

`sui move new hello_world`

This creates: 
- the project root folder `hello_world`
- the `Move.toml` manifest file
- the `sources` subfolder which will contain Sui Move smart contract source files

### `Move.toml` File Structure

`Move.toml` is the manifest file of a package and is automatically generated in the project root folder. 

`Move.toml` consists of three sections:

- `[package]` Defines the name and version number of the package
- `[dependencies]` Defines other packages that this package depends on, such as the Sui standard library; other third-party dependencies should be added here as well
- `[addresses]` Defines aliases for addresses in the package source code

#### Sample `Move.toml` File

This is the `Move.toml` generated by the Sui CLI with the package name `hello_world`:

    ```
    [package]
    name = "hello_world"
    version = "0.0.1"

    [dependencies]
    Sui = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework", rev = "devnet" }

    [addresses]
    hello_world =  "0x0"
    sui =  "0000000000000000000000000000000000000002"
    ```

We see that the Sui standard library dependency here is defined using a GitHub repo, but it can also point to a local binary using its relative or absolute file path. 

### Sui Module and Package Naming

- Sui Move follows similar [naming conventions as Rust](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/naming.html)

- Sui Move module and package naming convention uses snake casing, i.e. this_is_snake_casing.

- A Sui module name uses the Rust path separator `::` to divide the package name and the module name, examples:
    1. `hello_world::hello` - `hello` module in `hello_world` package
    2. `capy::capy` - `capy` module in `capy` package
